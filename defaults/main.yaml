# Port to keep the communication channel between Follower/Observer and Leader. Nodes can apply this channel to accomlish the stuff like 
# periodical heartbeaten, commit log votes. One spcial case is for observer which will not participate the vote phase of commit log.

############################# Kafka Server #############################

# Directory containing Kafka broker configuration files.
kafka_config_dir: /etc/kafka

# The address the socket server listens on. It will get the value returned from
# java.net.InetAddress.getCanonicalHostName() if not configured.
#   FORMAT:
#     listeners = security_protocol://host_name:port

#     listeners = PLAINTEXT://your.host.name:9092

# A comma seperated list of directories under which to store log files, containing all the core assets like Partition Logs, Segments, Replicas.
# also is the location where the asynchronous write and read go to
kafka_log_dirs: /var/lib/kafka/logs

# The default number of log partitions per topic. More partitions allow greater
# parallelism for consumption, but this will also result in more files across the brokers.

############################# Kafka connect #############################

# The replication factor used when Kafka Connects creates the topic used to store connector offsets. 
# This should always be at least 3 for a production system, but cannot be larger than the number of Kafka brokers in the cluster.
